        Overview

        This repository showcases data engineering projects developed 
        while studying Data Engineering. It covers ETL workflows, 
        automation, real-time processing, version control, monitoring, 
        and cloud-based solutions using Apache NiFi, Airflow, Kafka, 
        Spark, PostgreSQL, and Elasticsearch.

        ðŸ”¹ Key Features & Implementations

        âœ” ETL & Data Integration
        â€¢ Built automated workflows with NiFi & Airflow for data ingestion.
        â€¢ Processed CSV, JSON, API data into PostgreSQL & Elasticsearch.

        âœ” Workflow Automation & Orchestration
        â€¢ Developed Airflow DAGs for data transformation and scheduling.
        â€¢ Optimized NiFi pipelines for efficient data processing.

        âœ” Data Cleaning & Validation
        â€¢ Used Great Expectations for schema validation and anomaly detection.
        â€¢ Applied pandas & SQL for data transformation.

        âœ” Version Control & Git Persistence
        â€¢ Integrated NiFi Registry with GitHub for versioning.
        â€¢ Tracked Airflow DAGs & Python scripts using Git.

        âœ” Monitoring & Logging
        â€¢ Configured NiFi REST API & processor logs for tracking.
        â€¢ Built Kibana dashboards for pipeline monitoring.

        âœ” Cloud & Big Data Integration (In Progress)
        â€¢ Experimenting with Kafka & Spark for real-time & batch processing.
        â€¢ Exploring AWS/GCP for scalability.

        âœ” Deploying & Managing Pipelines
        â€¢ Built staging and idempotent pipelines for production.
        â€¢ Used NiFi variable registry for automated deployments.

        âœ” Real-Time & Big Data Processing (In Progress)
        â€¢ Developed Kafka producers & consumers for streaming.
        â€¢ Built NiFi-Kafka pipelines for real-time processing.
